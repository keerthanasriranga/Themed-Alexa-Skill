# Themed-Alexa-Skill

This is a game that not only enriches your memory but also teaches you about the rich history of various Indian cities.
Begin by saying an Indian city, and alexa will add another Indian city and also tell you a fact about it. Each time you say a new word, you must repeat the previous word in order. 
You get a point for saying the list of cities n the right order in each round. 
Randomly, alexa could also state a fact about a city and ask you the corresponding city name. On giving the right answer, you get awarded 10 bonus points.
Once you have learnt about all the cities, or get the order of cities wrong, the game ends.If the user does not explicitly end the game, the list of words get carried to the next round.
